# RobloxVD
RobloxVD combines Google's Speech API and Node.js to allow users to speak into a microphone to loosely repeat what they've said in Roblox. (Still a work in progress, though)

## How to use
First, download the current source of the entire project, and extract it to a directory.
Click on `cmd.cmd` and type in these commands (it may require reopening it a few times):
```
npm install express --save
npm install body-parser --save
npm install cors --save
```
You should be able to open `cmd.cmd` one last time, and type `node serv.js` and it should show
```
[SERVER]: Starting webapp !
[SERVER]: Webapp is open at `localhost:80`!
```
(will continue later sorry)
